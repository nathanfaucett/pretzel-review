  description: `Do you like store brought white bread toasted in a toaster oven covered in fake butter served with a side of high-school concession stand nacho cheese in a pizza box from the 80's? no? neither do we. Please do not order the "Bavarian Legend". It's both a insult to the lovely region of Bavaria, and a wild misuse of the word legend. This is the first pretzel we have ever not finished.`,
